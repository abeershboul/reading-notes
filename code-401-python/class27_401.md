# Graphs

* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### common terminology used when working with Graphs:

1- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

#### Undirected Graphs: 

* An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

##### Directed Graphs (Digraph):

* A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

#### Complete Graphs 
* A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### Connected:
* A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

#### Disconnected

* A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges

### Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

### Graph Representation
We represent graphs through:

* Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List

### Adjacency Matrix

* An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix


### Weighted Graphs
* A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. This is what a weighted graph looks like:

### Traversals

* Breadth First : In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method


* Depth First : In a depth first traversal, our approach is a bit different than the approach used for breadth first. While the breadth first traversal uses a Queue to visit all children at a given level, the depth first traversal uses a Stack to visit all children of a given subtree. (This differs from our approach to tree traversal, where we visit nodes via recursive calls. Recursive calls use a call stack internally.)

## Real World Uses of Graphs:

2- Driving Directions
3- Social Networks
4- Airline Traffic
5- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
