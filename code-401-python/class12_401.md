## Stack and Queue

* Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

* Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle

## LIFO Principle of Stack

* In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called pop.

## Basic Operations of Stack

* Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
* Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
* IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
* IsFull: Check if the stack is full
* Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it

## Working of Stack Data Structure

## Stack Time Complexity

For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. O(1).

## Applications of Stack Data Structure

* To reverse a word 
* In compilers
* In browsers

## Applications of Queue Data Structure

* When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. 
* When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, etc. 

## Applications of Queue in Operating systems:

* Semaphores
*FCFS ( first come first serve) scheduling, example: FIFO queue
* Spooling in printers
* Buffer for devices like keyboard

 ### Application of Stack Data Structure:

 * Stack is used for evaluating expression with operands and operations.

 * Matching tags in HTML and XML
 * Undo function in any text editor.

 * Stacks are used for backtracking and parenthesis matching

 ## Advantages of Stack:
 * Stack helps in managing data that follows the LIFO technique.
* Stacks are be used for systematic Memory Management.
* It is used in many virtual machines like JVM.
* When a function is called, the local variables and other function parameters are stored in the * stack and automatically destroyed once returned from the function. Hence, efficient function 
management.
* Stacks are more secure and reliable as they do not get corrupted easily.

## Disadvantages of Stack: 

* Stack memory is of limited size.
* The total of size of the stack must be defined before.
* If too many objects are created then it can lead to stack overflow.
* Random accessing is not possible in stack.
