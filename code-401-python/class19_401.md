# Intro to Django

## What is Django?

* Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

### Django helps you write software that is:

* Complete
* Versatile
* Secure
* Scalable
* Maintainable
* Portable

## Is Django opinionated?

* Django is "somewhat opinionated", and hence delivers the "best of both worlds". It provides a set of components to handle most web development tasks and one (or two) preferred ways to use them. However, Django's decoupled architecture means that you can usually pick and choose from a number of different options, or add support for completely new ones if desired.

## What does Django code look like?

* URLs: While it is possible to process requests from every single URL via a single function, it is much more maintainable to write a separate view function to handle each resource

* View: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses

* Models: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, 

* Templates: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page),

### Sending the request to the right view (urls.py)

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('book/<int:id>/', views.book_detail, name='book_detail'),
    path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
    re_path(r'^([0-9]+)/$', views.best),
]

### Handling the request (views.py)

* iews are the heart of the web application, receiving HTTP requests from web clients and returning HTTP responses. 


from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    # Get an HttpRequest - the request parameter
    # perform operations using information from the request.
    # Return HttpResponse
    return HttpResponse('Hello from Django!')


#### Security Django provides multiple protections against:

* Cross-site scripting
* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* SQL injection
* Remote code execution
