## Django CRUD and Forms

## Django Forms

* An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

### Django form handling process

Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

### Based on the diagram above, the main things that Django's form handling does are:

* Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user
* Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
* Clean and validate the data
* If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
* If all data is valid, perform required actions (such as save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, and so on).

### Form

* The Form class is the heart of Django's form handling system. It specifies the fields in the form, their layout, display widgets, labels, initial values, valid values, and (once validated) the error messages associated with invalid fields. The class also provides methods for rendering itself in templates using predefined formats (tables, lists, etc.) or for getting the value of any element (enabling fine-grained manual rendering).
