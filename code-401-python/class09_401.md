## data structures

* A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

### Why are data structures important?

* Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.

* Data structures are the building blocks for more sophisticated applications. They are designed by composing data elements into a logical unit representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application

# How are data structures used?

* In general, data structures are used to implement the physical forms of abstract data types. Data structures are a crucial part of designing efficient software.

* Early programming languages -- such as Fortran, C and C++ -- enabled programmers to define their own data structures. Today, many programming languages include an extensive collection of built-in data structures to organize code and information

###  examples of how data structures are used include the following:

* Storing data. Data structures are used for efficient data persistence, such as specifying the collection of attributes and corresponding structures used to store records in a database management system.

* Managing resources and services.

* Data exchange. Data structures define the organization of information shared between applications, such as TCP/IP packets

* Ordering and sorting.

* Indexing

* Searching

## Characteristics of data structures

* Linear or non-linear. 

* Homogeneous or heterogeneous. 

* Static or dynamic.

## Types of data structures

* Array.
* Stack. A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that operations are applied. This order could be last in, first out (LIFO) or first in, first out (FIFO).

*Stack. A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that operations are applied. This order could be last in, first out (LIFO) or first in, first out (FIFO).

* Linked list. A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item, as well as a reference, or link, to the next item in the list.

* Tree. A tree stores a collection of items in an abstract, hierarchical way. Each node is associated with a key value, with parent nodes linked to child nodes -- or subnodes. There is one root node that is the ancestor of all the nodes in the tree.

## How to choose a data structure

* Supported operations. What functions and operations does the program need?

* Computational complexity. What level of computational performance is tolerable?

* Programming elegance

## Data Structure and Algorithms - Linked List

* A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

### Types of Linked List

* Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

* Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

* Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

### Basic Operations

* Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

* Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

* Display − Displays the complete list.

* Search − Searches an element using the given key.

* Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
