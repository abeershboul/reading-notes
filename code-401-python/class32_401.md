### Benefits of Tailwind CSS?
* You write less custom CSS
* You keep CSS files small
* You don’t have to invent class names
* You can make safer changes

### Why Tailwind CSS?
* Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesn’t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.
For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site.
