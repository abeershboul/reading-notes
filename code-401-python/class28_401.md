# Authentication & Production Server

## What is JSON Web Token?

* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
1- Authorization
2- Information Exchange

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

* In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

* Header : The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
* Payload : The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
* Signature: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

### The following diagram shows how a JWT is obtained and used to access APIs or resources:

### Why should we use JSON Web Tokens?

* As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller, making JWT more compact than SAML

* Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm.

* JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. 

### How JWT Works?

* The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

* The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).

* The refresh token lives a little bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. 


###### If you want to run Django in production, be sure to use a production-ready web server like Nginx, and let your app be handled by a WSGI application server like Gunicorn.

If you plan on running on Heroku, a web server is provided implicitly. You donâ€™t have to take care of it. You just need to specify a command to run your application server (again, Gunicorn is fine) in the Procfile.
