## What is SWR?

* SWR stands for stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. It basically means that it performs data fetching in 3 steps:
1- Returns cached data first (stale)
2- Sends the fetch request (revalidate)
3- Returns the up-to-date data


### Step 1: Install package

npm install swr

### Step 2: Import useSWR

import useSWR from 'swr'

### An example of usage of the Hook is as follows:

const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/123', fetcher)

### Step 3: Write a fetcher function

import axios from 'axios'

const fetcher = url => axios.get(url).then(res => res.data)



### Why use SWR?

1- Built-in Cache + Real-Time Experience
2- Auto Revalidation
3- Pagination
4- Local mutation
5- Dependent fetching
6- Smart error retry
7- Supports fetching from both REST and GraphQL APIs
8- Typescript and React Native ready

### With just one single line of code, you can simplify the logic of data fetching in your project, and also have all these amazing features out-of-the-box:

* Fast, lightweight and reusable data fetching
* Built-in cache and request deduplication
* Real-time experience
* Transport and protocol agnostic
* SSR / ISR / SSG support
* TypeScript ready
* React Native
