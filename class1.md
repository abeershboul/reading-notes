# Introduction to React and Components
## React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
# What is a “component”?
## Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

## 2-Component name. The name of the component.

## 3-Component type name. The name of the component type that is associated with a component

# What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
### Advantages of Component-Based Architecture
Component-Based architecture reduces the cost of development and maintenance. It is reusable which means can be used to reusable components to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications. It increases the reliability of the whole system via reuse

# What is "props" short for?

### "Props" is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

# How are props used in React?

### We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s))

# What is the flow of props?
### 
We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). Props is just a shorter way of saying properties. They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic
