# Intro to Big O Notation

## Big O Notation is used to measure or describe the performance of any algorithm by providing the order of growth of the function.

## Types of Big O Notation :

* O(1)  describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
* O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
* O(NÂ²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
*  O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

## Names and Values in Python

### data type

* number
* flouts 
* string
* list 
* tuples 
* dectionary 

### Rules for Python variables:

* variable name cannot start with a number
* variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
* variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* Variable names are case-sensitive

### * Mutable Aliasing, lists have methods on them that when called they are modified in-place, however, strings, int, floats and tuples have no methods on them, making them immutable

### * Refrences can be more than names, it can be 

Object attributes, list elements and dictionary keys and values, anything on the left side of an operation is considered an assignment.

### * Names has no type but a scope and Values have no scope but a type

## Awesome Python Environment

### * The Interpreter: pyenv is a wonderful tool for managing multiple Python versions.use pyenv to install almost any python interpreter, including pypy, and anaconda.

### * Dependency Management poetry help you

* separate your projects through virtual environments

* build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.

### * Type-Correctness

Mypy is a static type checker for python code, that finds errors before they appear.

### * Automate the Automation

Pre-commit is a tool that executes checks before you commit code to your repository

## Python Module of the Week

PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by "Doug Hellmann" to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library. It is based on the original PyMOTW series, which covered Python 2.7. [2] The site offers breakdowns of the Python Standard Library modules, including, but not limited to:

* Text Manipulation

* Data Structures

* Algorithms

* Cryptography

* Concurrency and Multithreading

* Internationalization

* Networking
